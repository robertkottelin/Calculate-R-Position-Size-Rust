This rust application will calculate your asset position size based on: 
- How much you want to trade with
- How much you want to risk
- What your stop loss is 
- If it's full size (1R), half size (0.5R) or lower size

Input:
- Trade size (USD)
- R value (ex 1)
- Risk percentage as float (ex 0.02)
- Stop loss delta (USD)

Use "cargo run trade size, R-value, risk percentage, stop loss" without commas

Example: cargo run 1000 1 0.02 500
